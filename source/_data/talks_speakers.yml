        talk_description: "One of the peculiar aspects of microservices architecture is the
          possibility of designing a system as a set of independent but
          collaborative components. At the root of this collaboration there
          are  well-defined contracts among all the microservices: breaking even a
          single contract might compromise the health of the entire system.\r With
          AWS Lambda, we have the ability to simply create an ever-increasing number
          of microservices and, therefore, it becomes crucial to find a way to catch
          errors in advance whenever one of these contracts has been broken."

          a robust and highly capable RDBMS.  However, achieving optimal performance
          at scale requires careful consideration of the underlying file
          system.   This presentation will talk about ZOL (ZFS on Linux), a powerful
          and advanced file system originally developed by Sun Microsystems. ZFS
          point of strength are robust data storage management, data integrity, data
          compression, snapshotting, and efficient storage allocation. However ZFS
          performances are terrible if compared with the native file systems like
          XFS or EXT4.  This presentation will help the attendees to have a better
          understanding for harnessing the power of ZFS and run PostgreSQL at scale
          levels not so different from XFS or EXT4. "

        talk_description: È sempre un argomento delicato prendere il lavoro di un collega e proporre
          un refactoring perché possa essere automatizzato. Ma una volta trovato il
          sistema di gestione che si adatta meglio alle vostre esigenze, sarà un
          gioco da ragazzi! AWS mette a disposizione alcune soluzioni fully managed
          per un ciclo MLOps, altre possono essere una combinazione di servizi.
          Tutto dipende dal ciclo di vita del modello, dalle figure coinvolte e
          dall’effort che si ha a disposizione. Dopo una breve introduzione delle
          figure coinvolte e delle soluzioni principali che potremmo adottare con i
          servizi AWS, le metteremo a confronto in termini di effort, knowledge,
          tempi d'implementazione e costi.

        talk_title: "Case study: How we brought order to our Matomo Saas with DevOps"
        talk_description: The Digitalist Cloud motto is 'For the public good', with this general
          scope in mind we have set up a SaaS service offering GDPR safe web
          analysis tools based on the Opensource project Matomo. Many of our clients
          are from the Swedish public administration, but awareness and interest in
          ethical web analysis is constantly increasing in all business sectors. In
          this presentation I want to show how applying Rancher to our different
          Matomo clusters have proved fruitful for our organisation, in terms of
          getting an immediate and clear overview of crucial operational info on the
          infrastructure and application status, as well as how applying Neuvector
          has facilitated the monitoring and management of security risks in the
          system. We'll dive into our pipeline architecture and show how our
          continuous updates are deployed seemlessly with ArgoCD. Finally I'll demo
          our recently released and much requested add-on tool, RebelMetrics, an
          analysis dashboard for advanced visualization and exploration of the data
          and smoother reporting for the clients.

        talk_title: "Compliance As Code: shift-left and shift-right approach in a Cloud world"
        talk_description: Maintaining compliance in a Cloud world requires a new approach that
          maximizes the balance between agility and safety. Just like we use
          infrastructure-as-code in infrastructure automation and approach of CI/CD
          in application lifecycle management, at the same time our DevSecOps teams
          should adopt compliance-as-code, especially in a cloud world. We can
          introduce compliance-as-code on the left side of the DevOps lifecycle
          and/or on the right side. Working on the left side we can detect issues
          very early in the process, but our tests are limited in scope, more
          related to a specific workload. On the right side, we can detect and
          remediate issues that would be difficult to anticipate during the building
          phase, we can assess the resources against requirements defined at a more
          high level, but the improvement requires more effort. On the left side, we
          can leverage general-purpose tools such as OPA - Open Policy Agent - an
          open-source engine incubated in the CNCF. On the right side, it's better
          to leverage services provided by the Cloud provider as AWS config

        talk_title: Platform Engineering Is Not About Tech
        talk_description: "What are we using for pipelines? Which infrastructure do we support? Is
          service mesh enabled?'. These types of questions - revolving on tech
          choices and implementation - currently occupy most of the conversations
          around platform engineering. According to most evidence, though, these are
          not the only things that make a cloud-native platform successful: cultural
          change, communication and collaboration, reorganized processes, shared
          vision and roadmap - among others - play a key role in determining the
          success of platform transformation. If we don’t address change
          comprehensively, the risk is that in a few years we’ll discover that
          platforms are not bringing the results we expected. In this talk we’ll see
          some key aspects that are often overlooked in implementing a platform and
          how it’s possible to address them along the way. We’ll also share some of
          the pitfalls and lessons we learned in our experience, supporting large
          and small organizations in building their cloud-native platforms."

        talk_description: Explore the convergence of cost management and development with FinOps in
          the context of Kubernetes. This talk presents an integrated solution to
          effortlessly collect costs from service providers' APIs, convert them to
          the FinOps Foundation FOCUS specification, and store them in a central
          data lake. Leveraging advanced algorithms, including machine learning, the
          collected data is analyzed to uncover opportunities for cost and quality
          of service optimization. This solution includes a closed-loop feedback
          system where insights gleaned from the analysis are fed back into
          Kubernetes to enhance integrated auto-scaling features. This talk will
          unravel the complexities of FinOps within Kubernetes, gaining practical
          insights into transforming cloud cost management and bolstering DevOps
          efficiency.

        talk_title: DevOps Real-Time Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning
        talk_description: "Logs and traces generated by applications are valuable sources of
          information that can help detect issues and improve performance. However,
          they are often treated separately from other data, even though they are no
          different from the data an application works with. In this talk, we will
          explore a different approach: treating logs and traces as part of a
          scalable cloud storage repository that can be analyzed with the same
          techniques used for big data. By keeping all the data together, we can
          apply machine learning models to detect situations of interest and alert
          us in real-time when unwanted behavior is occurring or brewing. This
          approach enables intelligent monitoring that goes beyond simple
          threshold-based alerts and can help identify complex issues that would
          otherwise go unnoticed. We will discuss how to harness existing
          technologies to implement this approach, providing attendees with
          practical tips and insights that they can apply to their own projects.\r "

        talk_title: Da dove arriva il codice Ansible che stai eseguendo?
        talk_description: "Solitamente il codice Ansible viene eseguito con un alto livello di
          accesso per assicurarsi che possa eseguire le azioni per cui è preposto.
          Questo alto livello di accesso, però, crea un potenziale rischio di
          sicurezza, dato che il codice potrebbe essere modificato da un attaccante,
          permettendogli quindi di eseguire codice arbitrario.\r Per evitare che
          questo possa succedere, si può utilizzare un processo di firma e verifica
          crittografica per assicurare che solo il codice autorizzato possa essere
          eseguito.\r In questa presentazione vedremo come si può integrare un
          processo di firma e verifica crittografica in Ansible. Ci soffermeremo
          anche su alcune decisioni e suggerimenti di implementazioni per assicurare
          che il processo risultante soddisfi tutti i requisiti."
